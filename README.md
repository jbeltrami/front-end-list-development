#TECHNOLOGIES:
  This project was developed using HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript, JQuery, CURL, AJAX, Handlebars, Bootstraps.

#FUNCTIONALITY
  For this project, I build a wish list for the user to keep track of wishes/accomplishments.
  It it possible to create a wish and access that wish (or wishes) on a table format later on. The user can also update and delete a specific wish at any given time.
  Future versions will turn this app into a new years resolution list, with accomplishment status and comments.

#PLANNING/DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:
  Followed the guidelines provided by G.A. consultants:
- Started with User Stories and Wireframes.
- Created basic non-styled HTML.
- Created Javascript and AJAX requests to ping API.
- Creates UI responses after AJAX responses.
- Adds Handlebars to some of those responses.

#UNSOLVED PROBLEMS
Give more style. Make it look better.

Creating a "Login with Facebook" button.
Create a "comment" button to add to wishes.
